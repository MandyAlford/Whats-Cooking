# Refractor Tractor


## Overview

For Refractor Tractor we took an existing project that a previous student built out (with hard coded data), and refactored it to take in data from an API. The app is essentially a recipe tracking application that allows users to view and favorite recipes. Users can also search for recipes by type, name, or ingredient. Users can also determine what recipes they could cook based on selected ingredients from their pantry. Finally a user can make two types of post requests by clicking on a particular button. One button ,(get-ingredients) allows a user to obtain all the ingredients necessary to cook a specific recipe. The other button, (cook-recipe) allows a user to cook a recipe and then all the ingredients from that recipe are subtracted from their pantry.
